   	   <H2> In case you were wondering, it's about books. </H2> 
   	   <p> UPDATE: Actually, I'm now reading a book about history. Percy Jackson is an average book series like 3/5. And why do I sound so formal? Oh, and sorry if this website is short. </p> 
   	   <p>I'm currently reading Percy Jackson. It's pretty good. It's a 3.5 star book series. In case you wanted to know I have listed them in order below. There is also a good book website below. </p>
